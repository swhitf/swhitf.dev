              <br /><br /> My bad habits are biting my nails, and cooking oven food
              on a Breville sandwich press.
              <br /><br /> I pretend to support Crystal Palace FC, but really I don't
              care about football.

        <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I was born on 20th August 1987 in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.
          Rotherham is very nice, you should go.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          On my 3rd birthday I ran away from my parents and their friends
          singing Happy Birthday to me and locked myself in my grandparents
          caravan.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          As a child I enjoyed sailing, computer games and collecting rare milk bottle tops. 
          One of those is a lie but I only had two things and three is better.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I didn't really enjoy school, and ended leaving with average grades
          and average memories.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I attended Nottingham Trent University, completed a placement at
          Hewlett Packard in Germany, and graduated with a 1st class degree
          in Software Engineering. Overall, university was good.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          From 2009 to 2016, I worked the following jobs:

          In 2016, myself and 4 others left Chelsea Apps and took our Large Global Accounting Firm client with us.
          We setup our own consultancy and were paid handsomley for our work from 2016 until 2019.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          In early 2019, we wound up the consultancy and, later on that year, I launched the first version of Metro Retro.

        <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          In 2017 I get engaged to the love of my life.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A year later, Covid-19 caused the popularity of Metro Retro to skyrocket.  Jamie Hanratty joins as our co-founder.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Two years later (which is WAY too long), Metro Retro took it's first paying customers.

        <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          After scrapping for another two years, Metro Retro joins TinySeed.

        <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          In 2025, Metro Retro rebrands as Ludi.co

        <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Also in 2025, I decide to make a personal website, I'll let you know how it turns out.
