For the last few years, I've really started to notice that I'm getting old.  I don't mean that my knees are starting to ache or anything like that, but more and more I'm interacting with people where the age gap between us is enough that I'll mention an actor, TV show or website and just get a blank look back at me.  Then the realisation sets in that I'm talking about something from 15 years ago when they were probably 10 years old.  

As I approach 40, this is happening to me more and more.  It's also happening for young developers that I meet today as well.  Many of them have started their career sometime around the mid to late 2010's and so for them, websites like Stack Overflow and now ChatGPT are _their world_.  They have a hard knowledge cut off of anything before that, just like LLMs cannot tell you anything about the last 6 months.  This was also true for me when I started in the mid 2000's.  As an example, I've heard of [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) and I vaguely know what it is, but I've never used it or seen what it looks like.

So in this post, I want to remember and celebrate some of the websites that I used to frequent around 2005 - 2012 when I was at university and starting out in my career.  Websites that pre-date Stack Overflow and AI tools.  Websites that anyone who has a knowledge cut off of 2010 might not have ever heard of.  Websites that were actually pretty big deals in the community, or at least in the .NET community, which is what I was part of in the first part of my career.

All these websites are still online, but the original sites have long gone and what remains are just immitations occupying once loved domains.  Thankfully though, due to the glory of The Wayback Machine, we can still visit them.

## The Code Project

- Domain: www.codeproject.com 
- Active: 2005 - 2024

Let's begin with probably the most influential source of online learning for me during my early years.  The Code Project was a developer community with articles and tutorials on a wide variety of subjects.  It was the kind of website you just went to when you wanted some coding related juice.  These days, I go to Hacker News or Reddit for this, but honestly The Code Project was better.  New articles and tutorials were added multiple times per day.  It covered .NET, C++ and Windows development, web development and to a lesser extend other languages such as Perl.

I really hit my stride with programming during my University placement during which I worked a lot with C# and Windows Forms.  I spent a lot of hours following tutorials written by the community on The Code Project covering custom controls, background threads, GDI+ and drawing custom graphics to the screen.  Here is a random example on archive.org of a tutorial I might have followed: [.NET's ThreadPool Class - Behind The Scenes](http://web.archive.org/web/20050207001423/http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/threadtests.asp)

This website was just pure programming fun.  The design was bright and friendly.  The home page was bursting with new articles, forum posts, featured items - it all gave a real sense of a thriving and buzzing community.

If you visit www.codeproject.com today, there is a website there, the alien logo is there, but it's a shell of it's former self.  At the time of writing, the home page has articles that were published 13, 14 and 17 days ago marked as Just Published.  Compare that to 24th Feburary 2005 when 10 articles where published in two days.

Around 2013 I got a job that didn't require me to use .NET as much, so I stopped visiting The Code Project as often.  But whenever I did I'd get that warm feeling of visiting a place you used to spend a lot of time in.  It was always a cheer to see people still writing about anything and everything about .NET, Windows and the like.  

It really was a special place on the internet, and I'm grateful to all the contributors for the many hours of learning I got out of it.

## 4 Guys From Rolla

- Domain: www.4guysfromrolla.com 
- Active: 2005 - 2024
- Hayday: Mid 2005 - 2010

Next up, 4 Guys From Rolla.  Started in 1998, by four college friends (I guess from [Rolla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolla,_Missouri)), the strapline for this website was "When you think ASP, think... 4 Guys From Rolla".  Obviously, it was heavily ASP and ASP.NET focused.  Since I worked a lot with ASP.NET earler in my career, I spent a lot of time here.  The story is similar to The Code Project.  It had a dense and wide open design giving off the impression of activity and life as soon as you open the home page.  The articles were in-depth, interesting and well written.  There was also a message board and community that I didn't really engage with, but I believe were popular and active.  You could go there and know you were going to find something interesting to read.

In particular, I always liked the personal touch they had with their logo of the 4 guys.  On every visit, I would pause and wonder what the 1st guy is doing on the floor, appearing to be rocking back and forth while his three collegues lark around.  I assume it's some kind of in joke from the original writers, and I like that kind of thing.

The site today is well and truely dead.  Again, if you go to the domain there is a website there, but I have no idea what it is or why it exists.  The articles are bizzare AI slop about about cars, crypto and online gambling.  The _Contact Us_ button links to 4guys@freeemail.biz and the Twitter and YouTube links go to some dead looking service called ENEWS.gg.  

I hope the original 4 Guys are doing well, they created something special and I'm grateful for the time they put into it.

## Final Thoughts


What was so great about this website was you could be certain on each visit that you were going to find something interesting to read and learn something you didn't know.  There was no politics, 

It makes me sad that I can't do that any more.  I can go on archive.org, but it's not the same.  It's like watching a video of a friend or loved one who is no longer with you.  You can see them but it's not the same.
