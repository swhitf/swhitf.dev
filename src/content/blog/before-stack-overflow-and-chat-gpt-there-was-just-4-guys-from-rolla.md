For the last few years, I've really started to notice that I'm getting old.  I don't mean that my knees are starting to ache or anything like that, but more and more I'm interacting with people where the age gap between us is enough that I'll mention an actor, TV show or website and just get a blank look back at me.  Then the realisation that what I'm talking about is over 15 years ago sets in.  This whole thing really does creep up on you at first, but as I approach 40 it's happening to me more and more.

This is true for young developers that I meet today as well.  Many of them have started their career sometime around the mid to late 2010's and so for them, websites like Stack Overflow and now ChatGPT are their world.  They have an knowledge cut off of anything before that, kind of like LLMs to for the last 6 months of history.  This was probably true for me when I started in the mid 2000's.  As an example, I've heard of Usenet and I vaguely know it was a forum of some kind, but really I have no concious memory of it.

So in this post, I really want to just remember and celebrate some of the websites that I used to frequent around 2005 - 2012 when I was at university and starting out in my career.  The first part of my career was dominated by C# and .NET development, so there is a obvious .NET twist to all these sites.  

All these websites are still online, but they are not the same sites that once occupied their domains.
