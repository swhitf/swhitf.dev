## Hello there

If you are reading this, first, thanks for visiting.  I have for a long time intended to build some kind of personal website.  Really, I should have done this about 5 years ago when I launched my first product, Metro Retro.  

I _should_ have documented my journey and all the ups and downs it's had.  After a certain point, having not done it at the right time gets in the way, and you say to yourself that it's too late.  Man, I wish I had grown up sooner.  Anyway, as someone more successful than me said to me recently, the Second Best Time Is Now.  

I've been trying to live by that sentiment recently and fix all these things I've been putting off.  So here we are.

## This website

So, without anything else immediately to talk about in post number one, I'll just describe how I made this website.

It's built using [Astro](https://astro.build).  Which is a fantastic static site generator that feels like the perfect middle ground between simple and powerful. A few things I love about it:

- **Content Collections** - Built-in support for managing blog posts and other content with TypeScript type safety
- **Flexibility** - You can use React, Vue, Svelte, or just plain HTML/CSS
- **Performance** - Ships zero JavaScript by default, only hydrating interactive components when needed
- **Developer Experience** - Hot reload is fast, and the file-based routing just makes sense

In addition to Astro, I wrote the entire site using Claude Code.  Aside from the copy, _everything_ was prompt coded.  Even that gushing section above about Astro actually was written by Claude Code.  I left it in because to be fair, I agree with it all, but otherwise all the writing is mine.

At the time of writing I've spent $3.03 on Anthropic API calls, and I'm probably about half way through.  I expect by the end of today I will have the first version deployed.  I started at 10am and it's now 2pm.

I'm not sure if I feel good about this or not.  I hope to write more about my feelings on AI in coming posts.  For now though, I guess I'll just say; what a time to be alive.

## What's next?

The purpose of this site is to give me a space to write about and document my journey as a bootstrapped startup founder.  I'm about 6 years into this journey now, so feel like I finally have a few things worth saying.  

That is of course, after I've finished the missing pages in another $3 time.

Until then, thanks for reading.  And if you are interested, the code for this website is on [GitHub](https://github.com/swhitf/swhitf.dev).
